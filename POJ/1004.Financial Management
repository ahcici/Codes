Problem Description
Larry graduated this year and finally has a job. He's making a lot of money,
but somehow never seems to have enough. 
Larry has decided that he needs to grab hold of his financial portfolio and solve his financing problems.
The first step is to figure out what's been going on with his money.
Larry has his bank account statements and wants to see how much money he has.
Help Larry by writing a program to take his closing balance from each of the past twelve months and calculate his average account balance.
 

Input
The input will be twelve lines.
Each line will contain the closing balance of his bank account for a particular month. 
Each number will be positive and displayed to the penny. No dollar sign will be included.
 

Output
The output will be a single number, the average (mean) of the closing balances for the twelve months. 
It will be rounded to the nearest penny, preceded immediately by a dollar sign, and followed by the end-of-line.
There will be no other spaces or characters in the output.
 

Sample Input
100.00
489.12
12454.12
1234.10
823.05
109.20
5.27
1542.25
839.18
83.99
1295.01
1.75
 

Sample Output
$1581.42

//这道题是财务管理
//我的理解就是求十二个月的金额的平均值
//最开始我是写的下面一段代码
int main()
 {
     double s[12];
     double sum=0;     //因为是求平均数，我将所有与金额有关的变量全部定义为double
     int i;
     for(i=0;i<12;i++)
     {
         scanf("%lf",&s[i]);
         sum+=s[i];
     }
     printf("$%.2f",sum/12);        //这个是用数组来存储每月金额
     return 0;
 }     
 //当我回过头看的时候，我又重新写了下面这段代码，但是不能通过
 //所以我想问问你们，可以帮我解决不？
 
//为什么这样不行？？？
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int n=12;
    double salary=0;
    while(n--)
    {
        scanf("%lf",&salary);
        salary+=salary;       //直接计算十二个数的总值
    }
    printf("$%.2f",salary/12);
    return 0;
}

//每次重新赋值将salary值改变了

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int n=12;
    double salary=0,sum=0;
    while(n--)
    {
        scanf("%lf",&salary);
        sum+=salary;       //直接计算十二个数的总值
    }
    printf("$%.2f",sum/12);
    return 0;
}
