Your task is to calculate the sum of some integers.
 

Input
Input contains an integer N in the first line, and then N lines follow. Each line starts with a integer M, and then M integers follow in the same line. 
 

Output
For each group of input integers you should output their sum in one line, and you must note that there is a blank line between outputs.
